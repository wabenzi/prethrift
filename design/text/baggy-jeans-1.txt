The jeans are high-waisted with a relaxed, wide-leg fit that extends down to the ankles. They are made of denim with a faded blue wash, giving them a slightly worn-in look. The jeans feature large cargo pockets on both sides, adding a utilitarian style. Additionally, they are decorated with oversized, star-shaped patches on the lower legs, which have a distressed, frayed edge for a rugged aesthetic. The waistband is elasticated, providing a snug fit around the midriff.
