The garment on the left is a blue short-sleeved T-shirt featuring the text "ORINDA BASEBALL" in bold red and white letters across the chest, suggesting it may be a sports-related item, possibly from a youth baseball team in Orinda. The fabric appears to be cotton or a cotton blend, with a slightly worn look indicating frequent use. The shirt has a standard crew neck design and fits loosely on the wearer.
The garment on the right is a light gray short-sleeved T-shirt with the word "CALVIN" printed in blue across the chest, likely indicating the brand Calvin Klein, a well-known fashion label. The text is stylized and evenly spaced, and the shirt has a casual, relaxed fit, made from a soft cotton or cotton-blend material.
