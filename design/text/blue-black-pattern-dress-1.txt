The dress is a sleeveless, knee-length garment with a fitted bodice and a flared skirt. It features a vibrant, multicolored pattern dominated by shades of orange, blue, and white, with intricate geometric and tribal-inspired designs. The bodice has a scoop neckline with a subtle trim, and the fabric appears to have a slight sheen. The skirt flares out from the waist, creating a full, A-line silhouette, and includes layered ruffles or pleats at the hem for added texture and volume. The overall design combines bold colors and patterns with a structured yet playful shape.
