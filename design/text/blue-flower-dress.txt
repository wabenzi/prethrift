The garment is a long, elegant dress in the style of a traditional Chinese qipao (cheongsam), likely inspired by mid-20th-century designs. It features a high mandarin collar and long, sheer sleeves with delicate ruffled cuffs. The dress is predominantly light blue with a vibrant floral pattern of orange and white blossoms, accented by white piping along the seams. The fabric appears lightweight and flowy, with a fitted bodice that flares out into a subtle A-line skirt.
