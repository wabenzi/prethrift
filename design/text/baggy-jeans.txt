These are wide-leg jeans featuring a relaxed silhouette, crafted from denim in varying shades of blue. The primary color is a medium blue, complemented by darker blue accents, particularly around the waistband and pockets. The jeans are adorned with a unique design element: two large, frayed star appliqu√©s on the outer sides of each leg, adding a playful and edgy touch.

The waistband is elasticized for comfort, and there is a cargo pocket on one side, enhancing functionality. The overall style is casual and trendy, suitable for streetwear or relaxed outings. These jeans are versatile for various seasons, particularly spring and fall, and can be paired with casual tops or oversized sweaters for a laid-back look.
